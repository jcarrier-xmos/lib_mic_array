       * For example a sample filter based on the @ref DcoeSampleFilter class
       * template applies a simple first-order IIR filter to the output of the
       * decimator, in order to eliminate the DC component of the audio signals.
       * 
       * If no additional filtering is required, the @ref NopSampleFilter class
       * template can be used for `TSampleFilter`, which leaves the sample
       * unmodified. In this case, it is expected that the call to 
       * @ref NopSampleFilter::Filter() will ultimately get completely
       * eliminated at build time. That way no addition run-time compute or
       * memory costs need be introduced for the additional flexibility.
       * 
       * Even though `TDecimator` and `TSampleFilter` both (possibly) apply
       * filtering, they are separate components of the `MicArray` because they
       * are conceptually independent.

       * rate, and after any post-processing of that output stream by the sample
